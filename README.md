# Statistical Analysis: Gender Disparity in Technology

This project conducted a statistical analysis, utilizing chi-squared testing, to examine gender disparities in the tech industry. The analysis focused on two aspects:

1. Earnings Disparity: 
      The analysis focused on women with job titles of data scientist and research scientist, as well as women with master's and doctoral degrees. The objective was to uncover any disparities in earnings   
      between women and men in these roles.

2. Age Distribution: 
      The analysis explored differences in the age distribution between men and women in the tech industry. By examining their age profiles, the project aimed to identify any variations and potential 
      implications related to age-based disparities.

This project provided insights into gender disparities in earnings and age distribution within the tech industry. The findings contributed to a better understanding of the challenges faced by women in the industry.
